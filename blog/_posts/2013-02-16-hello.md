### Semantic Linefeeds

In the tutorial, 
I ask students whether or not the Sphinx text files 
in their project will be read by end-users. 
If not, then I encourage students 
to treat the files as private “source code” 
that they are free to format semantically. 
Instead of _fussing_ with the lines 
of each paragraph so that they all end near the right margin, 
they can add linefeeds anywhere 
that there is a break between **ideas**.


> This is a blockquote.
> 
> This is the second paragraph in the blockquote.

- Candy.
- Gum.
- Booze.
